To test with the recordings, there should be a run.m script that I’ve made which should run through all the .wav files (provided they are all in the same folder).

All that needs doing is for the directory of the folder containing the recordings to be assigned to the variable Folder as a string.

Also, just a warning, my code is still pretty buggy and doesn’t work amazingly well with artefacts just yet (something that I do want to fix in future).
